As an Assistant Professor at the University of Milan-Bicocca, my research focuses on formal explainable AI, integrating symbolic methods and data science. With a solid background in modal logic(s) and formal methods, I specialize in creating interpretable AI models that leverage robust data representation techniques. 📊💡

My expertise bridges the gap between logic and AI, enabling innovative data interpretation and machine learning solutions with practical applications. I have developed symbolic methods that ensure data is accurately represented. My approach combines theoretical rigor with practical insights. 🤖🔍

I am thrilled to integrate my symbolic background with deep learning methodologies at the ANTHEM project. This collaboration is not just an opportunity to expand my skills in deep learning, but also a chance to contribute to advancements in healthcare. The excitement is palpable, and I can't wait to make a real impact. 🏥🚀

I am always open to exploring collaborations in AI, data science, and formal methods. I am genuinely excited about the potential opportunities and advancements we could achieve together. I am eager to connect with you to share insights and discuss potential collaborations. Let's work together to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve! 🤝🌟
